# Data in this project
Most of the data used in this project are generated by running experiments for some specific targets.

In the folder **data**, it contains the result of the observation of the number of linear regions with respect to different step size and window size in the input domain grid.

In the folder **W10**, it contains the result of the observation of number of linear regions with different scaling factors.

In the folder **W11/data**, it contains the result of the experiments to study the variation of the Lipschitz constant of the 4 pre-defined composed CPWL functions.

In the folder **W12**, it contains the result of the Lipschitz constant under the condition that the weights of the GHH model are normalized after each step.
