This project tries to implement a model to generate some continuous piece-wise linear (CPWL) functions which are represented by generalized hinging hyperplanes (GHH). A grid method is used to represent the input domain. The implemented method will partition the input domain into distinct linear regions based on the local gradients as shown in Figure 1. Some statistics related to the composed CPWL functions are investigated in this project, especially the number of linear regions and the Lipschitz constant.
For the number of linear regions, this project finds that this quantity grows slowly or stops to increase after a certain number of layers in the composition, as shown in Figure 2. This project also tries to find the cause of this saturation and exclude the possibility that it was caused by the step size or window size of the input grid.
For the Lipschitz constant, it has different behaviors based on the architectures of the composed CPWL functions. It can either converge to 0 or increase exponentially.
