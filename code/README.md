# an example of how to generate a GHH function
First, one should make sure the required libraries are installed(PyTorch, numpy, ...)

To begin with, we first import the GHH class.
```python
from GHH import *
```

In the folder **W10**, it contains the result of the observation of number of linear regions with different scaling factors.

In the folder **W11/data**, it contains the result of the experiments to study the variation of the Lipschitz constant of the 4 pre-defined composed CPWL functions.

In the folder **W12**, it contains the result of the Lipschitz constant under the condition that the weights of the GHH model are normalized after each step.
